CREATE DATABASE first_database;

USE first_database;

-- show current db
SELECT DB_NAME() AS [Current Database];

CREATE TABLE city (
    id int  NOT NULL IDENTITY(1, 1),
    city_name char(128)  NOT NULL,
    lat decimal(9,6)  NOT NULL,
    long decimal(9,6)  NOT NULL,
    country_id int  NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT city_pk PRIMARY KEY  (id)
);
NOT NULL -> This is a property telling us that this column canâ€™t be empty (must be defined)
IDENTITY(1, 1) -> is also a property of the column telling us that this value shall be generated automatically, starting from 1 and increasing by 1 for each new record
CONSTRAINT city_pk PRIMARY KEY (id) -> This is not a column, but the rule, telling us that column id shall contain only UNIQUE values. So only 1 city can have id =5
